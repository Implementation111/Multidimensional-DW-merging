# Multidimensional-DW-merging
## We show here the experimentation result of our article "An Automatic Schema-Instance Approachfor Merging Multidimensional Data Warehouses"
### The test of the examples arise in the article are in the files" Example hierarchy merging.md", "Example dimension merging.md" and "Example star schema merging.md" conercing respectively the algorithm of hierarchy merging, dimension merging and star schema merging.
### The test of the TPC-H data are in the files "test1.md" and "test2.md" which refers to the test which generate a star schema and the one which geenrate a constellation schema
### The queries for the creation of the DW tables are in the file Creation of the "DWs.sql"
